dear deliverance people,

i'm preparing a talk for the dzug conference about deliverance and xdv. and while preparing i came up with some questions. maybe someone can answer one or another...

can anyone point out a short release history of deliverance? from svn logs i can see that the project has started in may 2005 - quite a long time. how did this genius idea came up, how was the project started?

the "deliverance philosophy" docs say that deliverance did compiling rules to xslt some time ago. why was that dropped? cause xslt didn't support all wanted features? is xslt compiling still an option for a future deliverance version? (EDIT: svn logs say: "deprecate the XSLT renderer, which could not implement in-order rules")

why does xdv use a different rules syntax? i find the deliverance's syntax more flexible, especially in combination with selection-types. e.g. the use of "children"-selection-types makes much more clear what is happening. replacing the contents of an tag is done via the replace rule and the children selection-type where in xdv you have to use copy (unclear naming - won't expect to replace anything when copying). also append, prepend, before and after has unclear semantics.
is this issue a xslt limitation? or was it an old deliverance syntax and have this projects used the same syntax in ancient times?

a question to nate aune if he reads it: is the motini project a successor of banjo?


well, thats it for now :)

best,
hannes
